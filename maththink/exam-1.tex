1. The statement ...

$$(\exists m \in \mathbb{N})(\exists n \in \mathbb{N})(3m + 5n = 12)$$

is false.\newline

Proof: By cases. $n$ can only be 1 or 2.\newline

Take $n=1$, then we must add 7 to get 12 and there is no multiple of 3 that equals 7.\newline

Take $n=2$, then we must add 2 to get 12 and there is no multiple of 3 that equals 2.\newline

Hence there is no $m,n$ that satify the equation and the statement is proved.
