4. Prove that every odd natural number is of one of the forms $4n+1$ or $4n+3$, where $n$ is an integer.\newline


Proof: By the Division Theorem, any number can be expressed in one of the forms $4q, 4q+1, 4q+2, 4q+3$. Hence, any odd number has one of the forms $4q+1, 4q+3$, and the statement is proved.
