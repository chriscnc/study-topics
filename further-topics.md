From "Function Programming in Scala", pg 55 ...

List is just one example of what is called an algebraic data type (ADT). An ADT is just a data type defined by one or more data constructors, each of which may contain zero or more arguments. We say that the data type is the sum or union of its data constructors, and each data constructor is the product of its arguments, hence the name algebraic data type

(The naming is not coincidental. There is actually a deep connection, beyond the scope of this book, between the "addition" and "multiplication" of types to form an ADT and addition and multiplication of numbers.)
